        <div class="history"><b>Lasagna's</b> origins are debated, but it likely traces back to ancient Greece with a similar dish called "laganon". The lasagna we recognize today, with layers of pasta, sauce, and cheese, evolved in Italy during the Middle Ages. It has since become a staple in Italian cuisine, varying slightly from region to region, embodying the rich culinary tradition of Italy.</div>
        <div class="history"><b>Moqueca</b> is a traditional Brazilian seafood stew, originating over 300 years ago from the indigenous peoples of Brazil's coast. Originally prepared by slow-cooking fish wrapped in leaves, it has evolved to incorporate influences from Portuguese and African cuisines, adding ingredients like lime, garlic, and palm oil. The dish varies by region, with Moqueca Capixaba and Moqueca Baiana being the most famous variants.</div>
        <div class="history"><b>Feijoada</b>, considered Brazil's national dish, is a hearty stew of black beans with pork or beef. Its roots are tied to Brazil's colonial era, evolving from European stews. Popularized in the urban areas of Rio de Janeiro in the late 19th century, feijoada is a symbol of Brazil's diverse heritage and is traditionally enjoyed during leisurely weekend gatherings.</div>
